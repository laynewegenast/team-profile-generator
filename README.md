# team-profile-generator

## Application
### This is an application to generate a website displaying members of your desired team. Through Node.js and the command line the user will be able to add Managers, Engineers, and Interns of their given team and include desired information of those individuals. The information that one will be able to dislpay, presented by command line prompts, includes the individual's role, name, employee ID, email, and role specific options of office number, GitHub username, or university.

## Creation and Implementation
### To begin this challenge we were required to create failing tests for all different constructors that would be present in the assignment. After creating passing tests and constructors, I focused on creating my HTML template that I then used within my generated HTML, as well as the array of questions that would be presented through Inquirer when using Node in the command line. When the user answers all desired command line prompts the JavaScript file then automatically generates an HTML file that the user may present as their website. I also utilized Bootstrap framework for my basic styling that I plan to advance further in the future.
